# Vault

In addition to managing my notes, I also use Obsidian to enable platform-independent editing of my website content. For this purpose, a repository is being created here, which on the one hand enables the import as Go modules in the GoHugo-based web blog and on the other hand serves to synchronize the content. 

Further information on the implementation of the content creation workflow can be found here: https://github.com/traceofahuman/blog

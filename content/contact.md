For a quick and easy way to reach me, simply fill out the contact form above. 

**Please note** that the security/privacy of your message also depends on [Formspree.io](https://formspree.io) handling of the message (see their [security policy](https://formspree.io/security/)). If you require additional privacy, consider using the PGP for _end-to-end-encryption_ (E2EE) described below.

You can also send me an email directly from your own email client. However, please note that unless additional encryption (such as PGP) is applied, standard email communication is not end-to-end encrypted. To ensure end-to-end encryption, you can contact me via ProtonMail or use my public PGP key with your own email client:

- Email: traceofahuman@proton.me
- My public PGP key is available at https://keys.openpgp.org

Welcome to **Trace of a Human**—a small but intentional footprint in our vast, connected world. This is a space where I share thoughts, ideas, or perhaps just a few traces left on the internet. It's about giving back, offering something meaningful (I hope), and maybe sparking a bit of creativity along the way. Whether it's a philosophical or technical essay, or a tutorial, my goal is to connect, share, and exchange ideas with others (## [[contact]]).

**Why "Trace of a Human"?**

In a sea of data, I want to create something conscious and personal—something that stands apart from the many passive, platform-specific data streams. Each contribution, each thought, might become part of the puzzle that forms a human footprint or identity on the internet.
